# LUDO
  
Ludo is a dynamic board game for 4 players
has 4 pawns each. The player introduces pieces
to play by rolling the number 6 or 1.

The goal of the game is for the player to complete everyone
your pieces to the finish line (60 fields).

The game allows you to forge other players' pieces through
movement to the square with the opponent's pawn excluding
situations when the pawn is on one of the eight
"safe fields" and when it is on the field
more than one pawn from one of the opposing players.
Capturing a pawn and rolling a 6 gives the player
an additional die roll (capturing a pawn causes this
it returns to its starting position).

If a player rolls three sixes in a row, he loses
possibility of movement and possibility of re-ejection
the player next in line gets the die.

If a player rolls a number that prevents him from moving
any of the pawns (when all pawns are
in starting positions and no 6 or then was rolled
when the pawn is in front of the finish line and a higher number was rolled
from the number of squares that the pawn must cross to the finish line), the player
the next person in line gets the opportunity to roll a die.
